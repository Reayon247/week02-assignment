Week 2's tech educators coding assignment

## What went well

- I made a media querys bit for smaller screens
- i made the thumbnail bar and made it so you can click the images and it works
- positioned everything where i wanted it and made it so it works with any screen size
- all images have alt text

## What went not so well

- I just couldnt find a way to get the buttons to work. I just dont understand why my funtions wouldnt work
- I dont get how i could of accessed my array of objects to switch the images using the buttons
- I didnt understand why sometimes when i put an argument in a function it works and then other times it doesnt. they are very confusing.
- same with the return function, why is it not returning the index number
